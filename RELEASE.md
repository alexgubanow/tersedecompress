# Release Documentation

This document describes how **TerseDecompress** performs releases, why releases happen, and how to interpret them.

## Purpose

Releases signal reviewed, stable versions of the software for users. They provide:
- a unique version identifier
- release notes describing functionality and fixes
- references to where users can obtain the artifact and ask questions

## Versioning

We use semantic versioning **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**:
- **PATCH**: bug and doc fixes
- **MINOR**: new backward-compatible enhancements
- **MAJOR**: breaking changes (rare)

## Release Frequency

Releases do not happen on a fixed schedule. They occur when:
- a bug impacting users is fixed
- a new feature is completed and tested
- accumulated changes benefit a stable release

## Release Workflow

1. Work merged to `main` branch.
2. At least one additional maintainer approves.
3. All tests are passing in CI.
4. Release version bumped.
5. Human-readable **release notes** drafted (CHANGELOG/Release Notes).
6. Tag is created and pushed.
7. GitHub Release page is published with artifacts.

## Release Notes

Release notes include:
- high-level summary of what changed
- user-facing changes
- deprecated or removed behavior
- link to issues/PRs if relevant

## Dependencies

Current release also includes a list of tracked dependencies used at build time.

## Support and reporting

See SUPPORT.md for details on how users get help and report problems.
